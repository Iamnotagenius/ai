Sometimes these options don't work for the build you are trying to achieve, or are just plain bad. In this case, you can respec the focus in the $(l:amethyst_imbuement:altars/crystal_altar)Crystal Altar$(). This drops the focus back to the previous tier, allowing you to build it back up and try again."
