### Fixes
* Fixed third person model of the Spellcasters focus.
* Aspect gems are now in the gems tag as they should be.

### Additions
* Added config option to turn off totem augment burnout.
* The Builders Scepter can now strip logs like an Axe.
* Added inflammable totem augment. Provides fire resistance at the cost of totem durability while on fire/in lava.
* Added integration for _Pack It Up!_ backpacks.

### Changes
* Implemented new ScepterItems from the new Amethyst Core update. Scepter of Blades and Lethality are now swords, and the Builders Scepter is now a proper Mining Tool. The Scepter of the Vanguard is now a Mace.
* (This means that these scepters can now be enchanted with the applicable enchantments such as Sharpness, Efficiency, etc.)
* Updated the Unhallowed skin to make it stand out from regular zombies.
* Tweaked durabilities and damages on sword-like scepters.
