##Changelog for Amethyst Imbuement 1.19-18

###Additions
* Added a recipe book to the imbuing table. If EMI, REI, or JEI are installed, their viewers take precedence. Otherwise a plain recipe book icon will show next to the player inventory which will open the builtin recipe book when clicked.
    * Recipe book shows several item categories, allows for favoriting, and transfers recipes to the table when all materials are available.
* Added glistering tome section covering scepter totem augments.
* A couple more scepters emit particles when held.

###Changes
* Added mixin from MixinExtras. Please let me know if any instabilities are noticed from this update.
* Increased damage multipliers of the Dangerous and Lethal modifiers.

###Fixes
* Removed duplicate common bookshelf block tag definition.
