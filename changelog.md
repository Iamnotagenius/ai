### Spell Overhaul
All existing spells have been tweaked and rebalanced. Any and all features of spells were reviewed, including
* __New Spells!__ - 12 brand new spells across all three schools of magic!
* Cooldowns and mana costs. Spells can now have scaling cooldowns, so some spells cast faster the higher the level.
* Scepter experience gain. Previously all spells gained 1 XP, now they each have a specific amount of XP gained per cast. This put grace and wit at a severe XP disadvantage, as their spells are slower on average.
* Damage, range, duration, etc. All the primary features of existing spells were rebalanced.

### Spell Scrolls
Spells also now exist on magical scrolls, rather than on enchanted books (though enchanted books still work if you can obtain a spell on one).
* Temporary scepters that can cast their contained spell a limited number of times before expiring
* Craftable from a knowledge book, providing an easy alternative to scepters for spellcasting if desired.
* Spells are now disenchanted as scrolls in the disenchanting table.
* Scrolls have a chance to appear at higher tiers, casting their spell more times and with higher level.
* Think of them like a multi-use potion, but even better!

### New Magical Offhands and Trinket Customization
Choose from a variety of new magical items that protect you and bolster you in your adventures in various ways
* Craft a powerful _Spellcasters Focus_ that draws power from your magic as you cast spells, igniting to higher and higher tiers, providing new scepter modifiers with each higher tier.
* Seal an aspect gem within a _Witches Orb_, granting your scepter 1 powerful and unique modifier
* Joining the other imbued jewelry is the _Copper_ and _Imbued Ward_, magical shields that can be augmented with trinket augments the same as the rings and other jewelry.
* Customize! Imbued jewelry and the other offhands now accept one of a variety of magical ingredients. Choose carefully! Each different ingredient provides a different innate bonus.

### And More!
That's not all the additions this update has to offer!
* The crystal altar has been upgraded, now accepting three inputs, enabling more diverse recipes.
* Craft hard light blocks directly, or create floating mystical light sources.
* Knowledge books now stack, saving a lot of precious inventory space.
* And more!
